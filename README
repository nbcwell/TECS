I am doing a self guided study of 'The Elements
of Computing Systems' (http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/)

In the course, you build an entire computer from logic
gates, then create an assembler, high level language
, and operating system. As I go through the course
I will be committing the projects to the git 
repository.

The software to run these files can be obtained
from the course website, as well as pdf files
of the textbook chapters.
