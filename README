I am doing a self guided study of 'The Elements
of Computing Systems' (http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/)

You basically build an entire computer from logic
gates, then create an assembler, high level language
, and operating system. As I go through the course
I will be committing the projects to the git 
repository.
